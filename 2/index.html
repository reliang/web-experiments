                        <p>The Penn & Slavery Project was started by a group of UPenn students who were
                            curious about the university’s link to slavery. As the project evolved and more
                            links were uncovered, there was soon a need for an app to educate and spread
                            information.</p>

                            ever since. I love drawing characters and experimenting with colors. I work mainly
                            in Photoshop.
