        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Class selection usually happens around the craziest time of the year, right smack in the middle of midterm
            season. After seeing an abundance of University of Pennsylvania students posting on Facebook asking how
            about
            certain classes and professors, my friends and I decided it's time to simplify the process. We came up with
            Penndoor--a glass door to the UPenn.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Currently, many platforms exist to facilitate University of Pennsylvania students in class selection. There
            is
            PennInTouch--the school’s official class selection platform, which provides basic course info, and allows
            students to plan on a schedule. There is PennCourseReview, which displays the course ratings collected by
            the
            school’s official survey. There is PennCoursePlan, where students can both see course reviews, and plan out
            their classes on a tentative schedule. But there simply isn’t a place for real user reviews!
            <br />
            <br />
            We aimed to create a product that would incorporate course ratings with user reviews, and act as a
            one-stop-shop
            for class selection info. To do so, we will pull course ratings from the school’s official course review
            survey,
            as well as collect and store user reviews on our own platform.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>The core design and development team consisted of three people, a developer, an illustrator, and me, the
            product
            and UI/UX designer. Both being in the creative field, I teamed up with the illustrator, and taught her some
            UI/UX basics so we can critique each others’ designs. Knowing that I don’t have the widest reach at Penn, I
            asked a few well-networked friends to join in on UX research, which involved surveying other Penn students
            on
            their class selection needs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>A Team gets it Done</h2>
        <p>With the help of my friends, we were quickly able to collect responses from 20 people based on what is
            important
            to them on a class selection platform.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">“I would like to know what kind of assignments would be involved. How understanding professors
            are
            with
            extensions. I guess how easily accessible professors are.”
            <br />
            <span>--a University of Pennsylvania student</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing I noticed after looking at the responses is that most of the information requested by people
            are
            too specific to be answered by survey questions, and justifies the comment format that we are aiming
            towards.
            The next step then, is to sort the responses. To better understand peoples’ needs and wants, I wrote the
            quotes
            onto post-it notes and organized it by category into an affinity map.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Organize, Organize, Organize</h2>
        <img src="images/penndoor/affinity-mapping.jpg">
        <p class="caption">My wall, featuring the affinity map, divided into 5 categories: Features, Difficulty Info,
            Time Consumption Info, General Info, and Professor Info</p>
        <p>The affinity map helped me realize what mattered to people the most about a class selection platform--1) the
            core
            features on the platform, such as the ability to filter class search, and 2) the class information displayed
            on
            the platform.
            <br />
            <br />
            The suggestions we received about platform features were extremely useful in the beginning stages of
            conceiving
            our product. The original idea for Penndoor was to create a platform where students can simply comment on
            classes, but after a respondent’s suggestion of using prompts to bring out the most relevant info, similar
            to
            Glassdoor, we decided to tweak our direction, and to include prompts as well as a comment box.
            <br />
            <br />
            The suggestions we received about class info are useful as well, since it could point us towards what
            prompts to
            use. However, they are so numerous that they took up more than half the wall, under the categories: course
            difficulty, time consumption, basic class info, and professor info.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>What Really Matters</h2>
        <p>As with most user interfaces, more isn’t better. The existing Penn Course Review platform, for example,
            includes
            12 ratings for each class section, ranging from the professor’s communication ability, to the value of
            assigned
            readings--I didn’t want to flood the user with an excess of information. Even though it was helpful
            collecting a
            number of suggestions on what info to include, we simply can’t include them all. To filter down the info to
            what
            really mattered, I created a second survey based on previous suggestions. With the help of my friends, we
            collected a total of 24 responses.
        </p>

        <br />
        <h2>All about the User</h2>
        <p>Piecing together the affinity mapping, the survey results, and what I observed from Facebook posts, I was
            able to
            get a clearer image of what the average user looks like. It seems like the majority of the users have two
            goals:
        </p>
        <p class="list">
            <span>1.</span> to find high-quality, interesting classes, often within their major
            <br />
            <span>2.</span> to find easy, less time-consuming classes, often for electives
        </p>
        <p>
            I brought the image of a Penndoor user to life through a user persona.
        </p>

        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>The Right Questions to Ask</h2>
        <p>With the user in mind, and the survey at our disposal, the team came together to select a set of prompts to
            include before the comment box. I explained the importance of using a limited number of prompts, as well as
            keeping the answers short and easy, as not to deter reviewers. For longer but still important questions, I
            suggested including them in the suggestions within the comment box. The team also considered a variety of
            other
            factors, such as whether the wording is ambiguous, to make the experience as easy as possible. Although
            still
            imperfect, this was considered a good starting point:
        </p>
        <div class="card">
            <p>
                General rating* [1-5]
                <br />
                Number hours spent on course* [1-50]
                <br />
                Is attendance important?* [Yes/No]
                <br />
                How hard is it to get an A?* [1-5]
                <br />
                Comments* [50-1500]
                <br />
                Suggestion: Talk about the good & bad aspects of the course. Describe the grading structure of the
                class.
                What is the average grade? How lenient is the instructor? How difficult are the exams and assignments?
                Anonymous?* [Yes/No]
                <br />
                Contact Reviewer: Email

        </div>
        <br />
        <h2>But Wait, How Do We Get Reviews?</h2>
        <p>A useful platform would naturally attract users, but how would one attract reviewers? To give people an
            incentive
            to write reviews, we decided that we should ask the site’s visitors to contribute. We came up with three
            possible solutions:
        </p>
        <p class="list">
            <span>1.</span> First time users are asked to make a review on the platform, then they can gain unlimited
            future
            access to other classes.
            <br />
            <span>2.</span>A point system is kept for each user. Everytime a user comments, they receive credits, which
            allow them to view a certain number of classes.
            <br />
            <span>3.</span>Users are kindly asked to make contributions, but not required to. The contribution
            suggestion
            would pop up everytime the user views, let’s say, 3 classes.
        </p>
        <p>I was worried about solution 2 since a point system can create a barrier to using this platform. The
            transactional nature of it also takes away from the good-natured intentions of our platform--allowing people
            to
            help people.
            <br />
            <br />
            After careful deliberation, we decided to use a mix of solutions 1 and 3. First, when people sign up for the
            platform, we will go through an onboarding, where we explain our need for reviews, and ask nicely for their
            review (exempt for incoming freshmen). This is a sure way of getting reviews, and is not as high of a
            barrier as
            other solutions. After the user goes through onboarding, they will have future access, but will be kindly
            reminded that reviews are important and appreciated.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Creating a Game Plan</h2>
        <p>
            To determine the necessary pages, I went on to make a user flow diagram. In my diagram, I aimed for a user
            flow
            that is as simple and intuitive as possible, while incorporating all the necessary features. I also asked
            the
            designer to join me on this exercise so we can discuss and draw strengths from each of our designs.
        </p>
        <img class="img-med" src="images/penndoor/User Flow.png">
        <p>
            Using the designs, we determined that the website needs at least 5 pages: the home (search) page, log-in
            page,
            onboarding page, class list page, and class info page. Next, I showed her how to draw wireframe sketches.
            After
            rounds of critique and discussion, I summed up our ideas with a final sketch:
        </p>
        <img class="img-med" src="images/penndoor/thumbnail-sketches.jpg">
        <br />
        <h2>A Splash of Color</h2>
        <p>Moving onto high-fidelity designs, I wanted to start it off with a mood board to capture the look and feel of
            our
            future product. This mood board was inspired by cleanly illustrated notes, yellow highlighters, and doodly
            illustrations.
        </p>
        <img src="images/penndoor/My Post 3.png">
        <p>To allow a smooth division of work between the illustrator and I, we first selected the color scheme--several
            sunny, energetic shades of yellow, and some soft grays. Then, she began creating illustrations for the
            website,
            while I began working on the logo, and the high-fidelity website design.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Final Design</h2>
        <p>To distinguish ourselves from existing platforms, the final logo involves a speech bubble. The landing
            illustration also features people talking and commenting.
        </p>

        <p class="caption">The final wireframe flow</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <p>Overall, it was a productive learning experience. I was glad to have exercised my design skills, and to have envisioned a product that could potentially help my fellow classmates. Here are just a few of my takeaways:</p>
        <p class="list">
            <span>1.</span><b>Work with a team, or ask for help from a friend.</b> Drawing on everyone’s strengths, the work was completed much faster. I first asked some well-networked friends to help me with UX research, which expedited the process. I then teamed up with the illustrator during the UI design phase to allow bouncing around ideas. We found that our strengths complimented each other--she had many unusual, creative ideas, whereas I designed with a focus on functionality and simplicity. 
            <br />
            <span>2.</span><b>Investigate, don’t assume.</b> One pitfall my team frequently fell for was assuming that our experiences represent someone else’s. However, even as University of Pennsylvania students ourselves, our experiences have differed largely. For example, while designing the prompts, one of us suggested asking whether attendance for a class is worthwhile, while another has never considered skipping classes.
            <br />
            <span>3.</span><b>Compromise.</b> As the product designer, I was sometimes tempted to impose product design principles I’ve learned onto my teammates during design discussions. Through the process, I learned to put down my ego and my role, and to listen to them. Everyone has a unique and valuable perspective, and can enrich the project as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the developer has gotten busy since then, and the development is stalled, the project was definitely worth doing. I would definitely jump on another opportunity to do the same.
